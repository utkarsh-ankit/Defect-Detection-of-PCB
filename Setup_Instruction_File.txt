Setup and Important Instruction:-



>>Requirements:-

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python 3.7.1
3. Libraries - Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Flask.   (all latest version) .
Note- I used Windows 10 OS.

*I will suggest to download whole repository in you computer's drive where Jupyter Notebook can access these files directly.*



>>There are 3 main coding files:-

1. defect_pred_i.ipynb                         
2. prediction_model_i.ipynb               
3. app_predt_i.ipynb

>>One trained weight file:-
1. model.h5

>>Three main folders:-
1. dataset (contains training and test dataset)
2. static (used by flask, contains image file to test)
3. templates (used by flask, contains HTML file to run)



Important Information:-


>> First file "defect_pred_i.ipynb" - It is the main file on which I created my Model and trained it. 
I will suggest "not" to run this file but to see whole model architecture in details. 
But if you want to run then skip the particular cell in which training takes place.


>> Second file "prediction_model_i.ipynb" - I save the trained weight file "model.h5" from "defect_pred_i.ipynb". 
And created a new notebook which check the image quality one by one. 
I suggest you to run this file and check the results by picking up images from 'dataset/test/test5/'   location.   
Note:- Remember to put the image-path inside-      r"(Image-path)"          .                                


>> Third file "app_predt_i.ipynb" - It is the web application file I made using Flask to run the prediction model. 
For running this, make sure the location you downloaded is right for Jupyter notebook to access. 
The folder it uses are  /templates/ for accessing HTML files and /static/ for image files, "so don't rename these files". 
After running every cell, it will give a url. After clicking on it, a web page will open. 
Select and Upload the image there and in the next page you will get the image will it's result.


>> In the templates folder you can check the HTML files which I created. 
This folder is used by Flask.


>> In the static folder you can check test images. 
[ The file named as "good ().jpeg" and bad().jpeg are of good and bad quality PCB images respectively. The Result (Good) and (Bad) written on the right side of the file name inside the BRACKET is the predicted result. So, you can compare the result with the file name. That's why I used the file name in that manner. ]. 
This folder is used by Flask.
 


Note:- Remember to put the image-path inside-      r"(Image-path)"   .
